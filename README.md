# ottawajs-p2p-web-talk
My presentation on the P2P web, focusing on Dat and the Beaker Browser

# Plans

- Quick demo
    - Make a site using Beaker
    - Load it
- What _is_ the P2P web
  - Centralization
    - Star topology diagram
    - Two people connect through the central node
    - If the central node is down, can't connect
  - P2p
    - Mesh topology diagram
    - Rout between two people
    - Alternate route between two people
- Why is Centralization so popular
  - Setting up a website is hard
  - DNS
  - Servers
  - Costs for bandwidth
  - Businesses want to control the data for profit
- Why has made P2P hard to use
  - Difficult to discover peers
  - Traversing networks can be difficult to set up
  - Dealing with malicious peers
  - Lack of easy-to-use tech
- Dat
  - Created to help share scientific data securely
  - Data is shared by linking to a URL
    - The URL is a public key used for encryption
    - Peers are found on the network using a discovery key that's derived from the public key
    - If someone doesn't know the URL, they can't see the data
  - Backed by append-only logs (hypercore)
    - Kinda like a blockchain, but the fundemental building block it's based on
    - Can load parts of the log from any peer and know that it's valid
    - Structure is efficiently stored such that you only need to get the subset that you want
  - High level API looks like a filesystem
    - Can read/write files and directories
    - Can watch for filesystem changes
  - The data is versioned
    - Can look at the change history
    - Can check out an older version
  - Diagram
    - Two sides with blocks
    - Some blocks are greyed out
    - Arrows representing downloads
- Discovery-swarm
  - Bittorrent DHT
    - Diagram of DHT
    - Can publish your IP address to advertise yourself to peers
    - Can find peers for data you want
  - MDNS
    - Advertise on local network
    - Discovery local machines without an internet connection
